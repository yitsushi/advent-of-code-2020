[Last year][2019], I tried to extend my knowledge and tried to solve
all puzzles with Haskell. Sadly, I had no time to learn more and more
because I don't use it daily as part of my job.

This is one of the reasons why I do it in Go this year. I have some
other reasons too like:

* I planned to do it with Go since February
* I hope I can face some beast this year and I can push my limits
* I want to play a bit safer this year as I have even less time
    than last year

Still curious and looking for the opportunity to work with Haskell
again more and more, but for now, I'll stick with Go.

**TODO**: Extend this document.
